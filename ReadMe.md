# Dan's Next.js Configuration Template

Me template for getting started on a Next.js app quickly with pnpm. Just click 'Use this template' to get started. This is a work in progress - I'm always adding to it to make it quicker and easier to create high-performance sites quickly.

## Features

-  Next.js App router in standalone mode
-  manifest.ts set up
-  robots.ts set up, with a custom CSP so that Lighthouse can download it (essential for perfect Lighthouse scores)
-  Express server for local testing

## ToDo

-  Add date-fns
